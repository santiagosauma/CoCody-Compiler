<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


CoCody is an educational programming language built to make learning programming accessible for beginners. üßë‚Äçüíª It was developed during the **1st Hackathon by C√≥digo Facilito** and is named in honor of Cody, C√≥digo Facilito's mascot. The language aims to introduce core programming concepts in an intuitive and beginner-friendly manner.

### Key Highlights üåü
- **Simple & Intuitive Syntax** ‚úçÔ∏è: Designed for beginners, CoCody's syntax makes it easy to learn programming basics.
- **Comprehensive Feature Support** üìã: Includes support for variables, arithmetic operators, conditional structures (`si...ENTONCES`), and loops (`mientras...HACER`).
- **Algorithm Efficiency** ‚öôÔ∏è: Efficiently handles classic algorithms such as **BubbleSort**, **QuickSort**, and **Linear Search**.
- **Cross-Language Translation** üåê: Integrates with the Gemini AI to translate programs into other programming languages, broadening accessibility.
- **Code Documentation Generation** üìù: Uses AI to automatically document code, making it easy to understand and share.
- **Debugging Visualizer** üìä: Includes a debugging visualizer that generates graphical representations of algorithms, helping users understand complex logic visually.

With CoCody, new programmers can learn fundamentals like working with variables, using arithmetic and logical operators, and implementing control structures, all within a fun and interactive environment.

For more details, we encourage you to explore the complete documentation. üìö

## Getting Started üöÄ

To set up CoCody on your local machine, follow these steps. We recommend using Anaconda to manage dependencies and virtual environments for an isolated setup.

### Prerequisites üìã

1. **Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)**: Download and install Anaconda for your operating system.
2. **Python 3.8 or higher**: Anaconda includes Python, so make sure you install a version that includes Python 3.8 or above.

### Installation üîß

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/santiagosauma/CoCody-Compiler
   cd CoCody-Compiler
   ```

2. **Install LLVM**:
   - Download LLVM from the following repository.
   - For Windows, download `clang+llvm-18.1.8-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.xz` from:
   
   ```sh
   https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-18.1.8
   ```

3. **Add LLVM to System PATH**:
   - After extracting LLVM, add its `bin` folder to the system PATH.
   - Example path: `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`

4. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the CoCody project folder, and create a virtual environment (e.g., `cocody_env`):
   
   ```sh
   conda create -n cocody_env python=3.8
   ```

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   After creating the environment, activate it:
   
   ```sh
   conda activate cocody_env
   ```

6. **Install Required Packages**:
   With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Set Up Environment Variables** (Needed for certain functions):
   CoCody might require certain API keys or settings in a `.env` file. Follow these steps to get your Gemini API Key and add it to the `.env` file:

   - Go to the [Gemini AI website](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and sign in to your account.
   - Navigate to the **API** section in your account settings.
   - Generate a new API Key and copy it.
   - In the root of your CoCody project, create a file named `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key:
     
     ```sh
     API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
     ```

   After adding this line, CoCody will be able to access Gemini's API for functionalities like code documentation, translation, and visualization.

8. **Run CoCody**:
   Once everything is set up, you‚Äôre ready to start using CoCody!

For more guidance on writing a compiler with Python, you can explore resources like [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@marcelogdeandrade/writing-your-own-programming-language-and-compiler-with-python-a468970ae6df) which was instrumental in the creation of CoCody.

## Usage

With CoCody, you can write programs using basic syntax to perform arithmetic operations, define variables, and use control structures like conditionals and loops. For example, a simple CoCody program might look like this:

```cocody
x <- 10
muestra(x)
si (x > 5) ENTONCES
    muestra("x is greater than 5")
FIN_SI
```

To get a better understanding of how to write CoCody code, you can refer to:
- [Example Cases](https://github.com/santiagosauma/CoCody-Compiler/tree/main/Casos): Explore examples of CoCody programs.
- [Documentation](https://github.com/santiagosauma/CoCody-Compiler/blob/main/Documentaci√≥n%20-%20CoCody.md): Learn more about CoCody‚Äôs syntax, supported operations, and features.

### Running a CoCody Program

Once you have set up the environment and written your CoCody code in a file (e.g., `my_program.cody`), you can execute it by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
.\run_cody.bat <filename.cody>
```

Replace `<filename.cody>` with the actual file name of your CoCody program. This command will interpret and run the program in the CoCody environment.
